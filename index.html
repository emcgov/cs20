      Sadly, this is not New Jersey. This is a photo from the top of Benbulben in Sligo, Ireland——my new favorite place. I hiked 
      this mountain this past summer and was blown away by how
      beautiful and peaceful it is. I loved all the sheep and rolling green
      hills.

      Although I've only gone once, I would say that my favorite restuarant as
      of right now is
      <a href="https://www.cafespaghetti.com/" target="_blank"
        >Cafe Spaghetti</a
      >
      in Brooklyn.

      I am an early bird and hate staying up late, which most people are
      suprised by. I'm happiest when I'm asleep before 10pm.
